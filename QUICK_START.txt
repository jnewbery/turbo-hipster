0) Clone bitcoin-abe into the repos subdir, e.g. `cd repos && git clone git@github.com:bitcoin-abe/bitcoin-abe.git`.

1) I suggest you install VirtualBox (from a website download) then `brew install vagrant`, then try a simple vagrant tutorial (http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html is good and does not take long, just spend like 10-20 minutes on this excluding time downloading VM images) to familiarise yourself with it, then run `vagrant up`. If you encountered any errors with vagrant up, save the terminal output and guest_logs/vagrant_mmc_bootstrap.log.

2) If there were no problems, pop into your development VM by running `vagrant ssh`. From now on, all commands are run within the VM.

3) Check that dogecoind is running, with `ps aux | grep doge`, if not run `/opt/dogecoin/dogecoind` (it should run as a daemon).

4) Tail /home/vagrant/.dogecoin/testnet3/debug.log and look for lines like the following:
"2015-05-27 01:58:44 UpdateTip: new best=ffb3a4e9217c79fe8a40a2d879c7e03656afbacee39eb2dcbb17e83633890df9  height=631113  log2_work=43.524284  tx=1033363  date=2015-05-27 02:00:14 progress=1.000000"
Keep an eye on the progress indicator. I found that if there's been too little progress here, abe freaks out, so let it reach something like 95% before continuing to the next step.

5) Install abe: cd /vagrant/vagrant/repos/bitcoin-abe && sudo python setup.py install

6) Abe needs to be run in two phases; first in "init" mode where it reads the dogecoin data directly, then in "rpc" mode where it communicates with dogecoind through rpc. For both, make sure your current working directory is /vagrant so that the abe-*.conf files are in the working directory.

7) For "init" mode, run:
python -m Abe.abe --config abe-init.conf --commit-bytes 100000 --no-serve

8) Leave that for a couple of minutes, and then you should not have to run it ever again. Then ctrl-c and run "rpc" mode with:
python -m Abe.abe --config abe-rpc.conf --commit-bytes 100000 --no-serve

9) Now play around with the system, and to stop abe simply ctrl-C. When you've made tweaks to the abe code, reinstall it (step 5) and run abe in rpc mode again (step 8). Repeat ad infinitum!
